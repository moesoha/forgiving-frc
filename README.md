# Forgive FRC

## How to use?

Plug in your camera*(Microsoft Lifecam HD-3000, or you have to change FOV in `ForgivingFRC/constant.py`)* to RaspberryPi and install some dependencies in shell:

	pip3 install pynetworktables imutils

You also have to install OpenCV for Python 3 correctly.

Then use `python3 season2017.py` to enjoy! Turning angle and direction will be pushed to `Forgiving/Vision` with NetworkTables.

## Why use this name?

Because "green" means "forgiving" to some degrees. We use bright green LEDs to light up the marking film. Although the finally color camera got is cyan.
