# Forgive FRC

## How to use?

Plug in your camera *(Microsoft Lifecam HD-3000, or you have to change FOV in `ForgivingFRC/constant.py`)* to RaspberryPi and install some dependencies in shell:

	pip3 install pynetworktables imutils

You also have to install OpenCV for Python 3 correctly.

Then use `python3 season2017.py` to enjoy! Turning angle and direction will be pushed to `Forgiving/Vision` with NetworkTables.

## Why use this name?

Because "green" means "forgiving" to some degrees. We use bright green LEDs to light up the marking film. Although the final color that the camera got is cyan.
